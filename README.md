# Physical Activity Classifier Using Machine Learning on Accelerometer Data
### Ria Sinha
### HarvardX: PH526x - Using Python for Research, Final Project

In this project, we'll attempt to predict the type of physical activity (e.g., walking, climbing stairs) from tri-axial smartphone accelerometer data. Smartphone accelerometers are very precise, and different physical activities give rise to different patterns of acceleration.

The project is divided into the following general steps: 
- **Data Preparation** - We will import the training data provided into `pandas` dataframes and normalize it.
- **Data Visualization** - We will use `matplotlib` to determine any clustering patterns within the data.
- **Model Selection** - We will experiment with multiple `sklearn` classifiers and select the one with the highest accuracy. 
- **Model Training** - We will fit the training data to the selected classifier. 
- **Model Prediction & Results** - We will use the selected classifier to predict labels for the test data.
